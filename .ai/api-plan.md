# REST API Plan

This REST API plan is designed to support the getTaste MVP. It is based on the provided PostgreSQL database schema (@db-plan.md), product requirements document (@prd.md), and technology stack (@tech-stack.md). The plan covers main resources, endpoint designs (CRUD and business logic), authentication/authorization, and validation rules.

---

## 1. Resources

The primary resources and their corresponding database tables are:

1. **Users** (table: `Users`)
   - Fields: `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `nick` (with check constraints on allowed characters and length), `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` (soft delete).

2. **User2FA** (table: `User2FA`)
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id` (unique, FK to Users), `verification_code`, `created_at`, `expires_at`, `verified_at`.

3. **Sessions** (table: `Sessions`)
   - Fields: `id`, `token` (unique), `created_at`.

4. **MusicPreferences** (table: `MusicPreferences`)
   - Fields: `user_id` (PK, FK to Users), `genres` (TEXT array), `artists` (TEXT array).

5. **FilmPreferences** (table: `FilmPreferences`)
   - Fields: `user_id` (PK, FK to Users), `genres` (TEXT array), `director`, `cast` (TEXT array), `screenwriter`.

6. **Recommendations** (table: `Recommendations`)
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id` (FK to Users), `type` (must be either 'music' or 'film'), `data` (JSONB for storing recommendation details), `created_at`.

7. **SpotifyData** (table: `SpotifyData`)
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id` (FK to Users), `album_id`, `artist_id`, `data` (JSONB), `created_at`.

*Additional Notes on Schema:*
- Relationships include one-to-one (Users â‡„ User2FA), one-to-(zero or one) for preferences tables, and one-to-many for Recommendations and SpotifyData.
- Unique indices exist on `Users.email`, `Users.nick`, and `Sessions.token`.
- Check constraints in `Users` (for `nick`) and `Recommendations` (for `type`) ensure data validity.
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies are assumed to be in place for enforcing per-user access.

## 2. Endpoints

Below are the designed endpoints for each resource and business process.

### 2.1. Authentication & Authorization

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Mechanism:** JWT-based authentication integrated with Supabase's auth system. All endpoints (except registration and login) require a valid token.
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Database-level policies ensure that users can only access their own records.
- **Role-Based Access:** Certain endpoints (e.g., admin-level changes) may require elevated privileges; middleware will enforce these roles.

---

## 4. Validation and Business Logic

- **Validation Rules (as per the DB Schema):**
  - **Users:**
    - Email must be unique and properly formatted.
    - `nick` must comply with the regex constraint and not exceed 20 characters.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - `type` field must be either 'music' or 'film'.
  - **Preferences:**
    - Ensure arrays for genres, artists, and cast contain valid strings.

- **Business Logic Requirements (from PRD):**
  - **User Registration & 2FA:**
    - Upon registration, a verification code is generated and must be validated via `/auth/verify-2fa`.
    - Both registration and login processes enforce 2FA.
  - **Profile Updates:**
    - Changes to user preferences automatically trigger re-evaluation of recommendations.
  - **Recommendation Generation:**
    - Integration with Openrouter.ai for dynamic recommendations based on profile preferences.
    - Recommendations are refreshed on login and/or explicit request.
  - **Spotify Synchronization:**
    - Backend triggers data sync with Spotify upon user login or via manual endpoint call to keep music data current.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Consistent error responses using standard HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 500).
  - Detailed error messages for validation failures.
